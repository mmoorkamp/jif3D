 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * jiba++ is a C++ framework for joint inversion of different types of geophysical data for sub-basalt, sub-salt and other
 * challenging imaging problems. The general idea of the joint inversion is similar to the jiba program by Heincke et al.,
 * however it is developed from scratch to provide maximal modularity and avoid lincence clashed between different parts of
 * the program.
 *
 * \section History
 *
 * \version Jan 2008
 * This version is the first milestone and contains the deliverables for scalar gravity and FTG forward modeling and associated tools.
