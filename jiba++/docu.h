 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * jiba++ is a C++ framework for joint inversion of different types of geophysical data for sub-basalt, sub-salt and other
 * challenging imaging problems. The general idea of the joint inversion is similar to the jiba program by Heincke et al.,
 * however it is developed from scratch to provide maximal modularity and avoid lincence clashes between different parts of
 * the program.
 *
 * Note that this is research code with a focus on numerical correctness and maintainability. This has two implications:
 *   - User input is rarely checked for correctness. The code performs some checks for consistency, but non-sensical values
 *     and incoherent model descriptions in the input files can cause crashes or random results.
 *   - While I have followed basic performance guidelines and used state of the art methods wherever possible, I have
 *     not performed any detailed speed optimizations of the code. Also, if there is a choice between clarity and speed
 *     I usually opt for clarity. However, some basic profiling indicates that there are no major bottlenecks caused by this.
 *
 * \section History
 *
 * \version Jan 2008
 * This version is the first milestone and contains the deliverables for scalar gravity and FTG forward modeling and associated tools.
