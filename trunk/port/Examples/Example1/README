This example demonstrates a very simple use case for the joint inversion code. In order
to run this you will need the netcdf operators from http://nco.sourceforge.net/ (under
Linux often available through the package manager) installed.

The bash script makemodels generates a synthetic test model and the associated synthetic
seismic and gravity data. In all likelyhood you will need to modify the path to
the executable depending on the compiler you use. The paths should match the names of
the subdirectories where the build system placed the executables. This is shown
when compiling the codes or you can inspect the bin subdirectories. The script
contains a brief explanation of what each program does. Calling the different
programs manually at the command line will usually display a prompt that
clarifies the values that are input into the program.


There are two joint inversion scripts. run_cross runs a cross-gradient coupling
based inversion of the seismic and gravity data. run_rel runs a joint inversion
using a fixed relationship between density and velocity.

Each run will produce a misfit.out file that contains the chi-squared misfit
for each dataset without normalization (i.e. we expect the final misfit to
be on the order of the number of data). You will also get result* files.
result1.tomo.inv.vtk, for example, contains the slowness model after the
first iteration in .vtk format. These files can be visualized using Paraview
(http://www.paraview.org/), Visit (https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/) and
a range of other programs. The final seismic model will be in the files
result.tomo.inv.vtk and result.tomo.inv.nc, while the associated synthetic
traveltime data is in the file result.inv_tt.nc. The ray distribution for
the final iteration is in the file ray.vtk
