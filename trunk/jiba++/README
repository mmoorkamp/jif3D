jiba++ Joint inversion code

Copyright 2008-2009 Max Moorkamp  All rights reserved.


This file describes the dependencies and compilation steps for the
jiba++ joint inversion code.


Requirements

The code uses a number of libraries and tools all of which are freely available, 
but have to be installed before compilation. Please refer to the respective 
documentation on how to install these components.

* Boost Jam
* Boost
These two are available from http://www.boost.org/users/download/

* netcdf from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/
* atlas from http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
* lapack from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
* cuda from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html#

Alternatively you can install all but cuda through the package manager on ubuntu 08/10.
Depending on the path you chose to install the libraries to, you might
have to modify the Jamroot file. Refer to http://www.boost.org/doc/tools/build/index.html
for a description of the syntax.

Compilation

Once you have installed everything and set the correct path you should only
have to run "bjam" from the jiba++ directory. Depending on your compiler
and whether you are doing a debug or release compilation, the programs and
libraries will be put in different directories. These will be output during
compilation.

This code has been compiled with

gcc 4.2 under SuSE Linux 10.1 and 11.0
gcc 4.3 under ubuntu 8/10
intel 11.0 under ubuntu 8/10

Sun 5.10 is known to fail, this is an issue with partial template spezialization in
the boost libraries.

No tests have been performed under Windows.
